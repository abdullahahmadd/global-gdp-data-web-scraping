## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **web scraping techniques** to extract nominal GDP data from an archived Wikipedia webpage. The scraped data is cleaned, structured, transformed, and analyzed to identify the top 10 largest economies in the world. The main focus is on working directly with **raw HTML content**, extracting meaningful information, and converting it into a usable analytical dataset.

The project workflow includes:

- Extracting GDP data from an HTML table using **manual web scraping**
- Parsing and structuring HTML content into a Pandas DataFrame
- Cleaning and converting GDP values from millions to billions
- Selecting the **top 10 economies** based on nominal GDP
- Engineering analytical fields:
  - GDP Share (%)
  - GDP Ranking
  - Normalized GDP Score (0–1)
- Exporting the final dataset for further analysis and use
